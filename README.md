Problem:

Agricultural business is one of the main water consumption units, an enormous amount of water gets used daily on corps, animals etc. However, not all the water gets to be used properly, a certain amount of water gets wasted each day due to issues like excess plant watering. This is not only ethically wrong, it also makes farmers waste extra money that could be saved.

Solution:
We decided to design a system that would resolve the excess watering by monitoring the soil moisture level and temperature. Our system will have multiple sensors across the entire farm, so that all regions would be monitored. Based on moisture level, the system will decide whether the specific region should be watered. Then it checks the temperature, as if it is low, watering plants can be harmful. If the soil is dry and temperature is decent, the system automatically activates sprays through relays. The farmer can monitor the process through the device. This solution is not only financially beneficial, it is also eco-friendly, which can be really important to some companies. 

Objectives:
Main objective to investigate is the power consumption for device parts. This is significant because the units will be placed across the farm with no access to sockets, which means that we need to use other sources like solar panels or batteries.  

Scope:
We are required to assemble a system that can operate through an entire farm, which area can be many kilometers. For that we need to select a proper communication protocol. Moreover, we need to decide on power management, so that the units can operate efficiently. These are the main things that are required to be investigated, the rest of the components are pretty clear and do not require much investigation
