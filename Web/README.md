ventilation system remote controlling site

# site features
The main idea of this project is to create an easy and convenient interface with a pleasant and safe design for monitoring and regulating the ventilation system. This project should have authentication in order to allow different users to have personal control over the system and should have a database to store data. Moreover, it needs to operate in Manual and Automatic modes that user can freely switch between.

The webpage has dashboard (views/index.ejs) and chart (views/chart.ejs). Dashboard is used to set either Speed or Pressure, depending on which mode is used, Chart represents data patterns.
